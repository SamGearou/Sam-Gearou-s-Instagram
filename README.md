This is a project based on the Youtube link provided above. This repo utilizes Ruby on Rails to make an instagram-like web page that allows you to register, login, and post photos with captions, and then the posts will be saved to your specific login information (stored in a database). The png files are all functionality photos, giving an idea of what the site looks like.
